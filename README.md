## Tech decisions:
- The project is built on top of Node JS, Express JS, MySQL as main technologies.
- For token strategy, it uses JWT.
- For password encryption strategy, it uses bcrypt.
- For CSV reading, it uses csv-parser and multer.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
It will install necessary dependencies.


### `npm start`
It will take a port (normally 3000) to run the server


## Future improvements
- cookies based authentication
- better error handling
- add models
- database optimization by joining tables
- overall code management
- .env var to add sensitive informations like db name, password, etc.
- etc

### Things to consider
- this web isn't built using best practices / approaches as I was struggling to find the right configuration and wasted several hours on it. Beside I don't have any experience building backend app.

### Please consider this
- 90% of the code was built only on the weekend, alongside with the backend code, as I had no holiday and main job was trimming me down.
- This is my 100%, given the current condition and situation.
